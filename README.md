# Python-for-Penetration-Tester

# WHY DO PENTESTERS USE PYTHON?
It’s relatively easy compared to other languages and it’s supported by all major platforms:  
Linux, OS X, and Windows. Not to mention it has an incredibly deep set of native libraries that in turn reduces the number of lines of code required.
And the best part? It has a highly active development community, which means there are thousands of third-party libraries being developed all the time.
This extends the native functionality of the language to accomplish nearly any task.
